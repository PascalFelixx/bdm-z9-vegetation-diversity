# 📓 Project Journal

This journal documents the ongoing progress, decisions, challenges, and reflections throughout the duration of the bachelor's thesis project.  
It supports reproducibility, transparency, and personal accountability.

> ⚠️ Note: I was only informed at a later stage of the requirement to keep a project journal.  
> Therefore, this document was created and backfilled retroactively with the earlier activities.
