# 🌿 Changes in Plant Diversity and Composition Over the Past 24 Years

## Assessed Using Z9 Data from the Swiss Biodiversity Monitoring (BDM)

---

### 📘 Project Overview

Since 2001, the [Swiss Biodiversity Monitoring (BDM)](https://www.biodiversitymonitoring.ch) program has been collecting standardized, high-quality biodiversity data from representative areas across Switzerland. This long-term monitoring occurs in five-year intervals and enables the assessment of trends in species diversity and community composition.

Despite its outstanding data quality and global uniqueness, the BDM dataset remains underutilized in ecological research. This project focuses on the **Z9 indicator** — vascular plants and bryophytes — and aims to conduct the first comprehensive analysis of the full dataset.

### 🎯 Project Objectives

- 📦 Preparation and harmonization of raw data (e.g. consistency checks, taxonomic alignment)
- 📈 Analysis of temporal trends in:
  - Species richness
  - Mean ecological indicator values
  - Community-weighted means/fractions of functional traits
- 🗺️ Investigation of spatial variation across elevation belts, biogeographic regions, and habitat types
- 🌱 Optional add-on: analysis of the role and trends of neophytes
- 📊 Visualisation of results using advanced, publication-ready figures
- 📝 Writing the thesis in the format of a scientific journal article
  → *Aim: Submit for peer-reviewed publication with the student as first author*
